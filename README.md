The purpose of the 201 tutorial is demonstrate the ability to build a Drupal site from a composer file.  We have already set-up this 
repo to container the output from "composer create-project" and prepopulated settings.php with database configration and profile name.

This repo is set-up exclusively for Acquia Cloud and can not be cloned into Dev Desktop due to a number of complex integration issues.  
You can use this branch in live development and run composer install in live development.

Checkout the files in this directory and copy them into your Acquia Cloud repository. Then run pipeline start.
