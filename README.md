# Hello, Pipelines

This tutorial demonstrates the simplest possible usage of Acquia Pipelines. The Pipelines YAML file simply creates a plain-text file, 
hello.txt, containing the text "Hello, Pipelines." 

To use it, commit all the files from this branch into your Acquia Cloud repository, push them to Cloud, then run ```pipelines start```.

To get the files, clone this repository and checkout the pipelines101 branch, or you can [download the ZIP file here](http://tutorials.pipeline-dev.services.acquia.io/pipelinestutorial101.zip).
