This tutorial demonstrates the simplest possible usage of Acquia Pipelines. The Pipelines YAML file simply creates a plain-text file, 
hello.txt, containing the text "Hello, Pipelines." 

To use it, commit all the files from this branch into your Acquia Cloud repository, push them to Cloud, then run pipeline start.
